# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

# Summary

Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game project! This project was created as part of my preparation for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) while ensuring I continue practicing and remembering the web development skills I previously learned.

## Project Overview

This classic Tic-Tac-Toe game is built using:
- **HTML**: To structure the game layout.
- **CSS**: To style the game for an appealing look.
- **JavaScript**: To implement the game logic and make it functional and interactive.

## Motivation

While preparing for DSA, I wanted to maintain and reinforce my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Balancing my DSA studies and revisiting web development skills was both challenging and rewarding. This project serves as a practical application of these technologies, helping me stay sharp and continue learning.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive UI
- Interactive gameplay
- Responsive design


## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the game.
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the game.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code to handle game logic.
